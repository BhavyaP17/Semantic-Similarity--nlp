"""
Semantic similarity: 
1. A program that calculates and displays the semantic similarity between a given sentence and a dictionary potentially related sentences 'en_core_web_md'.
2. Write a note about what you found interesting about the similarities between cat, monkey and banana and think of an example of your own.
3. Run the example file with the simpler language model 'en_core_web_sm' and write a note on what you notice is different from the model.

Pre-requisites:
install spacy library
install the english md model (en_core_web_md)
install the english sm model (en_core_web_sm)

Running the program:
Download the files in the repo on your machine, open the semantic.py file with your preferred IDE.

You can change the language model by using different variables for each model:
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md') 
nlp1 = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
